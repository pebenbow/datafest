## What is SQL?

**Structured Query Language (SQL)** is one of the most ubiquitous programming languages in the world of data. Invented in the 1970s, it is the dominant language for interacting with **relational databases**.

## How popular is SQL?

## What is a relational database?

There are different kinds of databases, but **relational databases** are by far the most universally adopted. You will find them at almost every enterprise, non-profit, government agency, or academic institution in existence.

Relational databases store data in rigidly-structured **tables** (*relations*) consisting of **rows** (*tuples*) and **columns** (*attributes*).

## What makes a database relational?

::::: columns
::: {.column width="35%"}
Tables within a relational database can be connected (related) to each other through the use of shared attributes/columns called **keys**.

## Where does SQL fit in?

-   In the real world, data scientists often need to retrieve data from the source database or a data warehouse, which means using SQL.
-   SQL has no data viz capabilities, and its statistical functions are limited, so Python and R are still critical components of the data science toolkit.
-   However, mastering SQL helps data scientists bridge the gap between where the data is stored and the environment they are using for analysis.

## Using R with SQL

```{r}
#| eval: false

db <- connections::connection_open(
  RPostgres::Postgres(),
  dbname   = "myDatabase",
  host     = "myServer", 
  port     = 5432,
  user     = "myUsername",
  password = Sys.getenv("myPassword")
)

sql_data <- DBI::dbGetQuery(
  conn      = db, 
  statement = "SELECT column1, column2 FROM someTable;"
)
```

## Take-aways

-   SQL is one of the most popular and useful programming languages in the world.
-   However, not enough data scientists are familiar with it.
-   It forms part of a trifecta of languages we think all data science students should learn: **Python, R, and SQL**.
